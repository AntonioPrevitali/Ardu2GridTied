# Ardu2GridTied
Arduino Due grid tied experiens

I am sharing here a proof of feeding energy into the grid.
The documentation has not been translated, contributors accepted, for now it is in Italian.

The documentation is in pdf format 
[Download](https://github.com/AntonioPrevitali/Ardu2GridTied/blob/main/Leggimi/Leggimi.pdf) here.

In addition to the documentation, I will shortly make the code available.
